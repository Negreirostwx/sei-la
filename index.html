            Do you know me?
            Really know me?
            You have opinions
            About my opinions
            About my music
            About my clothes
            About my body
            Some people hate what I wear
            Some people praise it
            Some people use it to shame others
            Some people use it to shame me
            But I feel you watching
            Always
            And nothing I do goes unseen
            So while I feel your stares
            Your disapproval
            Or your sigh of relief
            If I lived by them
            I'd never be able to move
            Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
            Would you like me to be quiet?
            Do my shoulders provoke you?
            Does my chest?
            Am I my stomach? My hips?
            The body I was born with
            Is it not what you wanted?
            If I wear what is comfortable
            I am not a woman
            If I shed the layers
            I'm a slut
            Though you've never seen my body
            You still judge it
            And judge me for it
            Why?
            We make assumptions about people
            Based on their size
            We decide who they are
            We decide what they're worth
            If I wear more
            If I wear less
            Who decides what that makes me?
            What that means?
            Is my value based only on your perception?
            Or is your opinion of me
            Not my responsibility?
